Wavefunctions represent the state of the beam as it propagates through the virtual microscope.  
Each probe position represents a different Wavefunction.  Wavefunctions share 
resolution with the Potential: a pixel in the Wavefunction is the same physical size 
as a pixel in a Potential slice.

These are natural targets for parallelization: each probe position can have its own Wavefunction,
while all of them can share the potential.
